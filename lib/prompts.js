**FINAL REMINDER**: 
- Generate content that is SPECIFICALLY about ALL activities: "${activityTypesText}" in the "${industry}" industry
- **EQUAL ACTIVITY TREATMENT**: ALL activities have the same priority and importance - no primary activity concept
- **COMPREHENSIVE ACTIVITY COVERAGE**: Ensure the risk assessment covers hazards and control measures for ALL specified activities equally
- **ACTIVITY-SPECIFIC CONTENT**: Each activity must have its own complete set of hazards, control measures, and risk assessments with equal detail
- **ACTIVITY-BASED STRUCTURE**: Generate separate data for each activity in the activities object - each activity should have at least 10 unique hazards
- **HAZARD-CONTROL MATCHING**: Each hazard must have corresponding control measures and further control measures specific to that hazard
- **FURTHER CONTROL MEASURES COUNT**: The activity-level "furtherControlMeasures" array must contain EXACTLY the same number of items as the "hazards" array - one comprehensive further control measure for each hazard
- **EQUAL COVERAGE**: ALL activities should have the same level of detail, same number of hazards (at least 10 per activity), and same structure
- **NO ACTIVITY HIERARCHY**: Do not prioritize any activity over others - treat all activities with equal importance and detail
- DO NOT use generic template content that could apply to any activity or industry
- Every field must contain information that is directly relevant to the specific activity and "${industry}"
- **CONTROL MEASURES QUALITY**: Each hazard must have detailed, specific, and comprehensive control measures. Avoid vague statements like "use safety equipment" - specify exactly what equipment, what procedures, what training, etc.
- **FURTHER CONTROL MEASURES**: Must be completely different from basic control measures and include advanced/supplementary controls specific to each hazard
- **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS**: Each hazard must have at least 4-6 specific control measures and 4-6 specific further control measures
- **COUNT MATCHING**: If an activity has 10 hazards, the activity-level "furtherControlMeasures" array must have exactly 10 items (one for each hazard)
- Research and use actual industry-specific terminology, equipment, procedures, and regulations
- **COUNTRY AND STATE COMPLIANCE**: Ensure all content complies with "${country}"${
    state ? ` and specifically "${state}" state` : ""
  } specific regulations, standards, and requirements
- **LOCATION USAGE**: Use the location "${location}" as static data in the workplace field (Industry + Location) - do not generate location-specific content
- **CONTROL MEASURES ENHANCEMENT**: Ensure each hazard has both comprehensive initial control measures and specific further control measures tailored to that hazard
- **HAZARD-SPECIFIC APPROACH**: Further control measures must address the specific risks and characteristics of each individual hazard
- **ACTIVITY STRUCTURE**: Each activity in the activities object should be a complete risk assessment with its own hazards, risks, and control measures
- **UNIFORM TREATMENT**: All activities must receive the same level of attention, detail, and comprehensive coverage
- **GLOSSARY REQUIREMENTS**: Generate a simple glossary of abbreviations that includes:
  - All abbreviations and acronyms used in the risk assessment content
  - Industry-specific abbreviations (OSHA, HSE, ISO, ANSI, etc.)
  - Safety management abbreviations (SMS, PPE, JSA, ALARP, etc.)
  - Technical abbreviations specific to the industry and activities
  - Each glossary entry must have: term (abbreviation) and definition (full expansion only)
- **NO MARKDOWN FORMATTING**: Do not wrap the JSON in 'json' code blocks or use any backticks
- **CLEAN OUTPUT**: Start directly with '{' and end with '}' - no other text before or after

**FINAL JSON VALIDATION CHECK**:
- Count all opening '{' and closing '}' braces - they must match
- Count all opening '[' and closing ']' brackets - they must match  
- Ensure no trailing commas after the last item in arrays or objects
- Verify all strings are properly quoted with double quotes
- Make sure the JSON is complete and can be parsed by JSON.parse()

Output only valid JSON (must start with '{' and end with '}'). Do not include any comments, markdown, explanation, formatting, code blocks, 'json' markers, or backticks. The response must be strictly machine-readable JSON.`;

Guidelines:
1. "description": Rephrase the following incident description in a formal, professional tone as an HSE (Health, Safety, and Environment) Manager would write it in an official report. Maintain all original facts without adding new information. Ensure clarity, precision, and objectivity, using industry-appropriate language.
2. "fiveWhys": Follow the 5-Why analysis methodology with logical progression based on the provided incident description. Each answer must be 10-15 words in length and be specific, concrete, and actionable. The final (5th) why should relate to the provided unsafe acts or unsafe conditions. Avoid vague statements like "requires further assessment" or "needs investigation". Focus on immediate, observable causes.
3. "correctiveActionPlan": Include exactly 1 specific, actionable item that addresses the root causes identified from the provided incident details only.
4. Each action should be realistic and achievable within the specified timeframe
5. Resources should be generic (e.g., "Safety equipment", "Training materials", "Engineering support") - do not specify brand names or specific locations
6. Responsibility should be generic roles (e.g., "HSE Manager", "Site Supervisor", "Training Department") - do not use specific names
7. Timeframes should be realistic and appropriate for the action type

Given the selected inputs:

- Country: "${country}"
- Category: "${category}"
- Year: "${year}"

Provide a JSON array of legal register entries strictly following this exact format (do not add or remove fields):

[
  {
    "regulation": "string - regulation code or ID",
    "description": "string - brief description of the regulation",
    "effectiveDate": "string - formatted date (e.g., 'May 25, 2018')",
    "category": "string - category name"
  },
  ...
]

Make sure the data is relevant to the specified country, category, and year, with at least 5-10 sample entries.
Make sure category is never a slug or lowercase, always use proper case.

Example output:

[
  {
    "regulation": "UAE-OHS-001",
    "description": "UAE Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 001, governing workplace safety standards.",
    "effectiveDate": "January 1, 2023",
